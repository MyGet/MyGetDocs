# SymbolSource

<div class="alert alert-block">
  <strong>Warning!</strong><br/>
  SymbolSource support is being deprecated and support for it <strong>will end on November 1, 2016</strong>.<br/> We recommend using the <a href="/docs/reference/symbols">MyGet symbol server</a> instead.
</div>

[SymbolSource](http://www.SymbolSource.org) lets consumers of your NuGet packages step through the source code and integrate with Visual Studio.
MyGet integrates with SymbolSource to host debugging symbols for your NuGet packages. In fact, MyGet has its own tenant on SymbolSource available at [https://www.symbolsource.org/MyGet](https://www.symbolsource.org/MyGet) (as opposed to the general public one at the site's root). When creating a MyGet account we automatically create a SymbolSource account within the MyGet tenant and sync your credentials.

MyGet comes with its [own symbol server](/docs/reference/symbols) but also provides integration with SymbolSource.org.

## Pushing packages to SymbolSource

With [NuGet.org](http://www.nuget.org), the NuGet client automatically recognizes symbols packages and pushes them to the default SymbolSource feed. MyGet uses a different feed on SymbolSource, making it possible to securely host your symbols packages. This does imply that pushing symbols to the MyGet symbol server consists of two steps instead of one.

The publish workflow to publish the SamplePackage.1.0.0.nupkg to a MyGet feed, including symbols, would be issuing the following two commands from the console (replace the GUID with your MyGet API key):

	nuget push SamplePackage.1.0.0.nupkg 00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000 -Source http://www.myget.org/F/somefeed/api/v2/package
	nuget push SamplePackage.1.0.0.Symbols.nupkg 00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000 -Source http://nuget.gw.SymbolSource.org/MyGet/somefeed

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> MyGet and SymbolSource share the feed's API key which can be found on the feed's details page. The same is true for passwords. If you modify your <a href="https://www.myget.org/profile/Me#!/Edit">MyGet profile</a> and update the password, you'll be able to <a href="https://www.SymbolSource.org/MyGet/Account/LogIn">log in to SymbolSource</a> as well.
	<br /><br /><em>Troubleshooting tip: if login at SymbolSource.org fails, update your password on MyGet to re-synchronize the connection with SymbolSource</em>

## Consuming symbol packages in Visual Studio

When logging in to MyGet, you can find the symbols URL compatible with Visual Studio under the Feed Details tab for your MyGet feed. This URL will be the same for all feeds you are allowed to consume, so no need to configure 10+ symbol servers in Visual Studio. Here's how to configure it.

![SymbolServer URL in MyGet feed settings](Images/feedsettings_symbolserver_url.png)

First of all, Visual Studio typically will only debug your own source code, the source code of the project or projects that are currently opened in Visual Studio. To disable this behavior and to instruct Visual Studio to also try to debug code other than the projects that are currently opened, open the *Options* dialog under the menu *Tools | Options*. Find the Debugging node on the left and click the General node underneath. Turn off the option *Enable Just My Code*. Also turn on the option *Enable source server support*. This usually triggers a warning message but it is safe to just click *Yes* and continue with the settings specified.

![Visual Studio symbol server settings](Images/debug-options.png)

Keep the *Options* dialog opened and find the *Symbols* node under the *Debugging* node on the left. In the dialog shown, add the symbol server URL for your MyGet feed: http://srv.SymbolSource.org/pdb/MyGet/username/11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111111. After that, click OK to confirm configuration changes and consume symbols for NuGet packages.

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> While the API key and user password for MyGet and SymbolSource are shared, it is not possible to trigger authentication for a symbols URL inside Visual Studio as it has no support for authentication. Hence it is recommended to keep the symbols URL to yourself at all time: it's a personal URL in which security information is embedded in the form of a guid. If for some reason this gets compromised, please <a href="https://www.myget.org/Support">contact support</a> and ask for a SymbolSource URL reset.
</p>

## Security

Each MyGet user and feed automatically gets its counterpart on SymbolSource, so you don't need to do anything apart from checking out the feed details page to discover what your push URL for symbol packages is and how to configure Visual Studio to download PDBs from your repositories. Your account's API key will enable you to push to both MyGet and SymbolSource, just as with NuGet.

MyGet keeps the following in sync with SymbolSource:

* Users
* User API keys
* User passwords
* Feeds
* Feed permissions

This means that if you give a user access to a feed you own, the same persmission set will apply to SymbolSource. If a user gets read-only access to a feed, he will also get read-only access to the symbols. When permissions for a user are revoked on MyGet, they will also be revoked on SymbolSource.

## Quick command cheatsheet

Here's a quick cheatsheet of the commands related to symbol feeds:

* Storing your nuget.org key, which also enables pushing to symbolsource.org:

	```nuget.exe setapikey <nuget-key>```

* Storing your myget.org key:

	```nuget.exe setapikey <myget-key> -Source https://www.myget.org/F/<feed-name>```

* Storing your myget.org key for symbolsource.org (this one you need to do explicitly):

	```nuget.exe setapikey <myget-key> -Source https://nuget.gw.symbolsource.org/MyGet/<feed-name>```

* Pushing a package to nuget.org [a symbol package will be detected and pushed to symbolsource.org automatically]:

	```nuget.exe push <package-file>```

* Pushing a symbol package to symbolsource.org explicitly (if you want to test it first):

	```nuget.exe push <package-file> -Source https://nuget.gw.symbolsource.org/Public/NuGet```

* Pushing a package to myget.org:

	```nuget.exe push <package-file> -Source https://www.myget.org/F/<feed-name>```

* Pushing a symbol package to symbolsource.org:

	```nuget.exe push <package-file> -Source https://nuget.gw.symbolsource.org/MyGet/<feed-name>```

## Debugging Issues

The following list of tips might be useful to you if you hit any issues whilst setting up SymbolSource integration. If you have some other tips to share, feel free to contact MyGet support or submit a pull request for this page.

### SymbolSource Authentication Fails

MyGet syncs your API key and credentials with SymbolSource. Make sure you use your **MyGet profile** username and password to authenticate against SymbolSource (and not the credentials from your identity provider such as Google, LiveId, Facebook etc).

If the error message states that *The sequence contains more than one element*, you might want to verify the credentials stored in SymbolSource. Log on to [the SymbolSource Authentication page](https://www.symbolsource.org/myget/Account/Authentication) and ensure that each entry has a unique Type.

If authentication for SymbolSource still fails, you might want to update your MyGet API key or credentials to trigger another synchronization. Do not ever change your credentials on the SymbolSource side, as there is no reverse integration from SymbolSource to MyGet. If this doesn't resolve your issue, please contact MyGet support.

### VisualStudio Doesn't Find Debugging Information in my Symbols Package

If you notice Visual Studio is downloading your .symbols.nupkg files but still doesn't find any debugging symbols, it likely means there's something wrong with the symbols package. There is a useful SymbolSource plug-in for [NuGet Package Explorer](http://npe.codeplex.com) which allows you to validate your symbols packages.
To install the plug-in, open NuGet Package Explorer and select `Tools > Plugin Manager...` from the menu. Click the `Add Feed Plugin...` button located to the top right of the dialog and double-click the SymbolSource plug-in from the MyGet feed.

![Installing the SymbolSource Plugin in NuGet Package Explorer](Images/npe_plugins_symbolsource.png)

This plugin enhances the package analysis tools with additional rules that should help detect 99% of the problems with symbols packages.
Simply open a symbols package and validate its contents before pushing it to SymbolSource by selecting `Tools > Analyze Package` or hit `CTRL-Q`.

A common root cause for symbols missing in the symbols package originates from a too restrictive nuspec file. The one below will filter out all non-DLL files from the package.

```<file src="C:\src\AwesomeLib\bin\Release\AwesomeLib.dll" target="lib\net40" />```

If you have a nuspec file which contains a similar line as the one above, you might want to change it to the following:

```<file src="C:\src\AwesomeLib\bin\Release\AwesomeLib.*" target="lib\net40" />```

The NuGet client tools are smart enough to filter out PDB files from non-symbols packages (unless you explicitly include them).

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> SymbolSource will most likely not index any binaries found in the package's \tools folder.
