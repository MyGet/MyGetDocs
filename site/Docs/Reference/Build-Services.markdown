# Build Services

MyGet Build Services allows you to connect to different types of source control systems:

* Git
* Mercurial (Hg)
* Subversion

Next to that, integration with several Source Control Repositories is available as well:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub")
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org "BitBucket")
* [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/ "CodePlex")

Once downloaded, source code can then be built using a number of different methodologies.

<p class="info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Although fully operational, MyGet Build Services is currently still in the Beta Stage.  While in Beta, you can't trigger a Build, manually or otherwise, faster then one every 5 minutes
</p>


## Tapping into the Build Process

Using MyGet Build Services, you have the opportunity to control exactly how your project gets built.  MyGet Build Services will scan the contents of your Source Control Repository looking for a file which it can work with.  In order of precedence, the following files are searched for:

* build.bat, build.cmd or build.ps1
* MyGet.sln
* Any other *.sln file
* *.csproj (and *.vbproj, etc)
* *.nuspec (yep, we support packaging simple [convention-based NuGet directories](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package#From_a_convention_based_working_directory "Convention Based Nuget Directories") as well)


## AssemblyVersion patching

When enabled for the build, MyGet Build Services will patch AssemblyVersion attributes in C# and VB.NET code. We are using Roslyn as the engine for parsing and updating attribute values. This approach is much more reliable than the regular expression based approaches most build systems use.

Two attributes will be patched: AssemblyVersion and AssemblyInformationalVersion.

* The patched AssemblyVersion version is always in the form major.minor.patch. A package version 1.0.0 as well as 1.0.0-pre will yield an AssemblyVersion of 1.0.0.
* The patched AssemblyInformationalVersion version supports semantic versioning and can be in the form major.minor.patch as well as major.minor.patch-prerelease.

Patching of these attributes will occur whenever the feature is enabled, no matter which build process is used (solution, project or build.bat).

## Pushing symbols

By default, when symbols packages (*.sympols.nupkg) are created, MyGet Build Services will push symbols packages to [SymbolSource](http://www.symbolsource.org). When disabled for the build, nosymbols packages will be pushed.

## Supported project types and SDK's

Build services supports the following frameworks and SDK's:

* .NET 2.0, .NET 3.0, .NET 3.5, .NET 4.0 and ,NET 4.5
* PCL support (2012)
* Windows Azure SDK 1.7, 1.8, 20.0
* Windows Identity Foundation SDK
* Silverlight 4, Silverlight 5
* Windows Phone 7.1 SDK, Windows Phone 8 SDK
* TypeScript SDK
* psake

The following test runners are supported:

* MsTest
* MbUnit 2, MbUnit 3
* NBehave
* NUnit (up to 2.6.2)
* xUnit.net
* csUnit
* RSpec

We believe adding frameworks and SDK's out-of-the-box provides a lot of value to our users and we want to continue investing in expanding the number of supported SDK's.

## Available Environment Variables

If you provide your own build.bat script or MyGet.sln, you can specifically instruct MyGet Build Services on how to act on your sources. This also means you'll need to take care of applying a version number to your build. That's why we provide you with the following set of parameters so you can benefit from using the version scheme you have already defined within the MyGet User Interface, as well as the build-counter attached to your build source. 

<p class="info">
    <strong>Note:</strong> that these environment variables are read-only and are reset to the initial values at the start of the build process.
